# **0. üì¶ Setup**
## 0.1. üìã Requirements
* Python >= 3.10
* Pip
* Docker
* Docker-compose

## 0.2. ‚öôÔ∏è Running project
**On unix-based systems**

First download the source code with the command:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/cenciati/{{ cookiecutter.repo_name }}.git
```

Now typing the following command `Makefile` will do all the dirty work for you, such as setting up a virtual environment with all dependencies installed and creating the docker container that will initialize the API:
```bash
$ make setup
```

Once you're done, you can clean everything just by typing:
```bash
$ make clean
```

# **2. üìÉ Strategy**
## 2.1. CRISP-DM
CRISP-DM stands for cross-industry process for data mining. The CRISP-DM methodology provides a structured approach to planning a data mining project. It is a robust and well-proven methodology.

This model is an idealised sequence of events. In practice many of the tasks can be performed in a different order and it will often be necessary to backtrack to previous tasks and repeat certain actions. The model does not try to capture all possible routes through the data mining process.
